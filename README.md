# MINIPROJECTS6

This is a Miniproject made as a part of our college curriculum for our semester 6. This project aims to analyze customer reviews of products and identify their sentiment.
This uses libraries like NLTK to do the sentiment analysis part and uses OpenAI API call to generate recommendations as to how the product can be improved based on the Reviews.
